			/*B: Class
	A class is a user-defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created.  
	It represents the set of properties or methods that are common to all objects of one type. 
	In general, class declarations can include these components, in order: 
	
	Modifiers: 			A class can be public or has default access. Refer to access specifiers for classes or interfaces in Java
	Class name: 		The name should begin with an initial letter (capitalized by convention).
	Superclass(if any): The name of the classâ€™s parent (superclass), if any, preceded by the keyword extends. A class can only extend 
						(subclass) one parent.
	Interfaces(if any): A comma-separated list of interfaces implemented by the class, if any, preceded by the keyword implements.
	 					A class can implement more than one interface.
	Body: 				The class body is surrounded by braces, { }.*/
