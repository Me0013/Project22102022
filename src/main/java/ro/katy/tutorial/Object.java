		/*It is a basic unit of Object-Oriented Programming and represents real-life entities.  
		 A typical Java program creates many objects, which as you know, interact by invoking methods. An object consists of :

	State: It is represented by the attributes of an object. It also reflects the properties of an object.
	Behavior: It is represented by the methods of an object. It also reflects the response of an object to other objects.
	Identity: It gives a unique name to an object and enables one object to interact with other objects.*/
